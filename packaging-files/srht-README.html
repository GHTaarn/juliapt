<h1 id="juliafromtar-deb-binaries">Juliafromtar .deb binaries</h1>
<p>The files in this repository have been automatically generated using
<a href="https://github.com/GHTaarn/juliapt">juliapt</a> . The scripts doing this are run once
every 24 hours, so be prepared to wait this amount of time before new Julia
versions are available here.</p>
<p>The purpose of this repository is to provide .deb packages containing
the Julia programming language.</p>
<h2 id="installing-the-deb-packages">Installing the .deb packages</h2>
<p>Decide whether to manually download the .deb packages or have them updated
automatically.</p>
<h3 id="download-and-install-manually">Download and install manually</h3>
<p>If your computer has <code>x86_64</code> architecture run the following from a <code>bash</code> prompt:</p>
<pre><code>wget https://taarn.srht.site/juliafromtar/stable/juliafromtar_JULIAVERSION-1_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i juliafromtar_JULIAVERSION-1_amd64.deb
</code></pre>
<p>If your computer has a different architecture, substitute <code>amd64</code> for
<code>arm64</code> or <code>i386</code> as appropriate.</p>
<h3 id="automatic-update">Automatic update</h3>
<p><em>Please be aware that this method bypasses some standard security measures as
I have not yet gotten around to signing the packages. Personally I comment out
the given line in /etc/apt/souces.list and only uncomment it when I know that
there is a new Julia version that I wish to install.</em></p>
<p>Type the following in the <code>bash</code> commandline:</p>
<pre><code>cp -i /etc/apt/sources.list . # Makes a backup of /etc/apt/sources.list in case something goes wrong
echo &#39;deb [trusted=yes] https://taarn.srht.site/juliafromtar stable/&#39; | sudo dd conv=notrunc oflag=append of=/etc/apt/sources.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install juliafromtar
</code></pre>
<p>Hereafter, any time you do an <code>apt upgrade</code>, the <code>juliafromtar</code> package
will be upgraded to the latest version.</p>
<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
<p><em>What is the difference between juliafromtar and juliapt?</em></p>
<p>Juliapt is a Github project with code to generate .deb files,
<code>juliafromtar</code> is the Debian package name of some .deb files generated by
<a href="https://github.com/GHTaarn/juliapt">juliapt</a>.</p>
<p><em>Why is the package named juliafromtar instead of julia?</em></p>
<p>The name <code>juliafromtar</code> is used instead of <code>julia</code> in order to differentiate
it from more official .deb packages containing <a href="https://julialang.org">Julia</a>
and to draw attention to that fact that it very closely follows the tar files
that can be downloaded from <a href="https://julialang.org">https://julialang.org</a> (rather than smaller packages
such as the
<a href="https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/julia">Debian Bullseye package</a>)</p>
<p><em>Why is juliapt hosted by Github and juliafromtar on SourceHut?</em></p>
<p>Almost all software development that I do is related to
<a href="https://julialang.org">Julia</a> and because the Julia community overwhelmingly
uses Github, it is preferable for me to have most of my work hosted there.
I made an exception for <code>juliafromtar</code> because Github cannot handle file sizes
greater than 100Mb which is close to the file size of the .deb files that I
wish to have hosted. Having <code>juliafromtar</code> hosted on 
<a href="https://sourcehut.org">SourceHut</a> is therefore
safer if the size of the .deb files were to increase in the future.</p>
<p><em>Can one have both juliafromtar and juliaup installed at the same time?</em></p>
<p>Yes, in this case the <a href="https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup">juliaup</a>
installation will be the default from the commandline whereas <code>juliafromtar</code>
will be what is run from the menu and <code>man julia</code> will refer to the
<code>juliafromtar</code> version.</p>
<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>
<p>I have been using the .deb files manually installed for
several months now and have had no serious issues.</p>
<p>Please report issues at <a href="https://github.com/GHTaarn/juliapt/issues">https://github.com/GHTaarn/juliapt/issues</a> and of course if you are
knowledgable about .deb files and repositories and want to help fix some of
the warnings then that would be great. I am not a Debian packaging expert
and only wrote this because I wanted to use something like this myself.</p>
