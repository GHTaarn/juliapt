# Juliafromtar .deb binaries

The files in this repository have been automatically generated using
[juliapt](https://github.com/GHTaarn/juliapt). The scripts doing this are run
once every 24 hours, so be prepared to wait this amount of time before new
Julia versions are available here.

The purpose of this repository is to provide .deb packages containing
the latest stable release of the [Julia](https://julialang.org)
programming language.

## Installing the .deb packages

Decide whether to manually download the .deb packages or have them updated
automatically.

### Download and install manually

If your computer has `x86_64` architecture run the following from a `bash` prompt:

```
wget https://taarn.srht.site/juliafromtar/stable/juliafromtar_JULIAVERSION-1_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i juliafromtar_JULIAVERSION-1_amd64.deb
```

If your computer has a different architecture, substitute `amd64` for
`arm64` or `i386` as appropriate.

### Automatic update

*Please be aware that this method bypasses some standard security measures as
I have not yet gotten around to signing the packages. Personally I comment out
the given line in /etc/apt/souces.list and only uncomment it when I know that
there is a new Julia version that I wish to install.*

Type the following in the `bash` commandline:

```
cp -i /etc/apt/sources.list . # Makes a backup of /etc/apt/sources.list in case something goes wrong
echo 'deb [trusted=yes] https://taarn.srht.site/juliafromtar stable/' | sudo dd conv=notrunc oflag=append of=/etc/apt/sources.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install juliafromtar
```

Hereafter, any time you do an `apt upgrade`, the `juliafromtar` package
will be upgraded to the latest version.

## FAQ

*What is the difference between juliafromtar and juliapt?*

Juliapt is a Github project with code to generate .deb files,
`juliafromtar` is the Debian package name of some .deb files generated by
[juliapt](https://github.com/GHTaarn/juliapt).

*Why is the package named juliafromtar instead of julia?*

The name `juliafromtar` is used instead of `julia` in order to differentiate
it from more official .deb packages containing [Julia](https://julialang.org)
and to draw attention to that fact that it very closely follows the tar files
that can be downloaded from https://julialang.org (rather than smaller packages
such as the
[Debian Bullseye package](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/julia))

*Why is juliapt hosted by Github and juliafromtar on SourceHut?*

Almost all software development that I do is related to
[Julia](https://julialang.org) and because the Julia community overwhelmingly
uses Github, it is preferable for me to have most of my work hosted there.
I made an exception for `juliafromtar` because Github cannot handle file sizes
greater than 100Mb which is close to the file size of the .deb files that I
wish to have hosted. Having `juliafromtar` hosted on
[SourceHut](https://sourcehut.org) is therefore safer if the size of the .deb
files were to increase in the future.

*Can one have both juliafromtar and juliaup installed at the same time?*

Yes, in this case the [juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup)
installation will be the default from the commandline whereas `juliafromtar`
will be what is run from the menu and `man julia` will refer to the
`juliafromtar` version.

## Issues

I have been using the .deb files manually installed for
several months now and have had no serious issues.

Please report issues at https://github.com/GHTaarn/juliapt/issues and of course if you are
knowledgable about .deb files and repositories and want to help fix some of
the warnings then that would be great. I am not a Debian packaging expert
and only wrote this because I wanted to use something like this myself.
